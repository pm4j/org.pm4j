  // Remark from olaf: I always had a lot of trouble to use generics in external parameter sets.
  //    Example: A best-match algorithm may provide this base interface. You get a lot of 
  //             trouble if you add the found binder to a typed binder collection or if you
  //             want to use the method signature with a concrete view-pm type combination.
  //             To reduce the trouble for the user of this API, I prefer to limit generics
  //             to the subclass implementation interface.
  //             In this class the VIEW type is only declared for the build() method.
  //             This helps in some situations to prevent casts and to allow inline-usage.
