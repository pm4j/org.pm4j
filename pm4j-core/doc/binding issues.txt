1. Do we really need two binder class hierarchies? 
   The factory hierarchy and the embedded Binder hierarchy too?

 Yes. To get a clear separation of configuration and runtime objects.

2. Shouldn't be the makeView method part of the Binder?
 This way the Binder may hold reference of some internal view artefacts..
