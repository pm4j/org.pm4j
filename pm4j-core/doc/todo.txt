Remoting
 Purpose
  - simplify the conversion of server objects to client objects.
 Approaches
  - provide a separate transfer model
  - use the pm on server side and use a functional subset to support the remote task.
 Remoting mechanism:
  - Associate remote root PMs to named server PMs
  - Configure for each sub-PM and PM aspect if it should be loaded with the parent.    
 DTO
  a) explicite dto fields (contra: serialization + memory footprint)
  b) explicite PM interface, internally a generic value map
  
 Serialization:
 - Add an enum (or class?) defining a serialization strategy.
 - Configure default in PmDefaults
 - Add an annotation, defining the serialization strategy.
 - implement specific handling for List, PmList, PmRef, PmTable, PmTree
 - add visibility and editability to dto
  

 - remote client uses the configurable caching mechanisms.
 - there is a pm communication channel abstraction
 - each server pm needs to be managed on the server
   . named objects + path navigation
 - client sessions need to be managed
   . server state is optional
 
 
 + named object transfer: Usage scenario -> impl.
