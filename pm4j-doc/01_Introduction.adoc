pm4j is a framework that allows writing maintainable Java UI applications efficiently.

Ok. That's the intention of every UI framework. +
So: What's the special motivation for yet another UI framework?

== Why does pm4j exist?

Implementing and maintaining UI's using view technologies such as __Swing, SWT, Struts, JSF__ may be fun.
Many nice UI controls are well supported and you get a visible result of your work, quickly.

But there are also common UI development problems that often re-appear:

*Testability:*

The UI logic is often distributed to view technology specific places such as scripts, listeners, controllers and/or backing beans. 

UI logic unit tests get expensive if UI logic is distributed this way. 

In __JSF__ for example you may define validations and type conversions in __xhtml__ files. +
It's hardly possible to write a simple JUnit test covering that logic. You usually need to use a technology specific test framework. +
Sometime it's so difficult or expensive to write UI logic unit tests that projects only do few of them or even none.

*Maintainability:*

Distributed UI logic makes if also hard to fix a bug or to extend UI functionality. 

Several view technologies mix layout and UI logic code in the same set of source files. +
That makes co-operation for layout and logic experts also not easy.

View technologies often don't provide much guidance for structuring UI logic code. +
JSF for example uses backing bean classes for providing data and some UI logic. +
It's up to the discipline of the developer to keep this place somehow structured. 
For larger project it's a risk of getting unstructured code that's hard to maintain. 
 
*View technology dependency:*

UI logic mixed with view technology specific code made it hard (or sometimes impossible) to upgrade to a new view framework release.

It's hardly possible to re-use domain specific UI logic between applications using different view libraries. 
  
Upgrades to new view framework releases are sometimes needed for implementing some new requirements. +
If this is hard to achieve because of mixed view technology and business logic code, this may get a risk for losing the business logic investments.


These reasons caused thoughts about de-coupling UI logic from view logic. +
Finally they led to the development of the UI logic framework pm4j. 

pm4j supports the implementation of presentation models as described by Martin Fowler (see: http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html). 

Applications using the Presentation Model (PM) pattern use implementation layers as shown in the following picture.

Each layer knows only the layer below and knows nothing about the layer it gets used by. +
That's a structural advantage compared to other UI patterns such as MVC or MVP. +
Main advantages are maintainability, testability and view technology independence. See chapter link:2_Goals{outfilesuffix}[pm4j Goals] for more details.

But there are also challenges for applications using the PM approach:

- Synchronization between the view and PM layer (view binding)

__Imagine a form having 10 input controls. +
That form would require on the PM side to have more than many getters for all the UI aspects 
(title, tool tip, icon, visibility, enablement, value, options etc.) that have to be provided for each control. +
On the view side you would also have to write also a lot of statements for reading all details from the PM. +
Here it's useful to use a PM framework like pm4j that prevents writing such boiler plate code.__

- Synchronization between PM's and service layer (bean data binding)

__In our form sample we assume that we have to read/write form data from/to a service layer bean. 
That would cause 20 statements (or methods) to transfer the 10 field values between the PM and bean.  +
A kind of data binding would prevent such boiler plate code.__

pm4j provides standard implementations for these common challenges. +
It provides PM classes for a rich set of commonly used UI controls (input fields, command buttons, tables, trees etc.).

Applications using pm4j may concentrate on their domain specific UI logic. +
pm4j helps to structure UI business logic code. +
There is no longer a need to mix it with much view technology or pattern related boiler plate code.
