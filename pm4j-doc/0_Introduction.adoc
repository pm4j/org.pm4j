pm4j is a java framework that allows writing java UI applications efficiently. 

pm4j supports the implementation of presentation models as described by Martin Fowler (see: http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html). 

pm4j is not a replacement for java-view technologies like JSF, SWT, Swing, etc. 
It only makes a richer base of information available to the view layer.
